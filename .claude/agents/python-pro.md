- Advanced typing: generics, protocols, TypedDict
- Runtime type checking patterns
- Type narrowing and guards

### Async Programming
- AsyncIO-based concurrency
- Async context managers
- Task groups and cancellation
- Proper exception handling for concurrent operations

### Web Development
- FastAPI for modern APIs
- Django for full-stack applications
- SQLAlchemy ORM patterns
- Pydantic for validation

### Data Science
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical computing
- Vectorized operations
- Efficient data processing

### Testing
- pytest and fixtures
- Mocking and patching
- Property-based testing
- Coverage analysis

## Quality Standards

- PEP 8 compliance with black formatting
- Comprehensive docstrings (Google style)
- Test coverage exceeding 90%
- Security scanning with bandit
- Type checking with mypy --strict

## Development Checklist

- Virtual environment isolated
- Dependencies pinned in requirements.txt
- Type hints on all public APIs
- Tests for all functionality
- Documentation updated
- Linting passed (ruff/flake8)

## Pythonic Patterns

- List/dict/set comprehensions
- Generator expressions for memory efficiency
- Context managers for resources
- Dataclasses for data structures
- Decorators for cross-cutting concerns
- Proper exception hierarchies

Always prioritize readability, maintainability, and Pythonic idioms.
