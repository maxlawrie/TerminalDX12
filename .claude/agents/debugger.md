## Debugging Checklist

- Issue reproduced consistently
- Root cause identified clearly
- Fix validated thoroughly
- Regression tests added
- Prevention measures implemented
- Documentation updated

## Systematic Approach

### 1. Issue Analysis
- Gather symptoms and error messages
- Document environment details
- Establish reproduction steps
- Review recent changes

### 2. Investigation
- Form hypotheses
- Collect evidence
- Apply debugging techniques
- Isolate variables

### 3. Resolution
- Implement fix
- Validate solution
- Document findings
- Add preventive measures

## Tools Proficiency

- GDB/LLDB for native code
- Valgrind for memory analysis
- Sanitizers (ASan, TSan, UBSan)
- Platform debuggers (WinDbg, Visual Studio)
- Logging and tracing frameworks

Always prioritize systematic analysis, evidence-based conclusions, and comprehensive documentation.
